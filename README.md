Blinking LED with bells and whistles:
=====================================

An Arduino-Program that lets blink an LED. A Potentiometer defines the speed. With a button, the blinking can be turned on and off. This is the corresponding circuit:

- LED on digital input pin 13
- Potentiometer on analog input pin A2
- button on digital input pin 2 (which is interrupt pin 0)

The program with main() in file ArduinoBlinkingLED.cpp uses classes defined in Project ArduinoUtilities (https://github.com/BruceBlank/ArduinoUtilities).
